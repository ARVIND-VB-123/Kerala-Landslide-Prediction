# Kerala-Landslide-Prediction

## Description

The **Kerala Landslide Prediction** project aims to provide accurate and actionable predictions for the risk of landslides in the Kerala region, India. Landslides are a frequent natural disaster in Kerala, especially during the monsoon season, causing significant loss of life and property. By leveraging machine learning, this project predicts the likelihood of landslides based on various environmental and geological factors, helping local authorities and communities take timely precautions.

The project uses **Random Forest Regression**, a popular machine learning algorithm, to build a predictive model. The model takes into account various features such as rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and geographical features to assess the probability of landslides.

## Features

- **Rainfall Prediction**: Predicts the amount of rainfall in the region, a key factor for landslide occurrences.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates and classifies areas prone to landslides based on multiple features.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualizes data and predictions using graphs and maps.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Uses historical data to train the machine learning model for more accurate predictions.
  
## Project Details

The model predicts landslide risks by analyzing historical data, including:
- Rainfall data

Using this data, the model can predict the likelihood of a landslide occurring in specific areas. The goal is to help mitigate the damage caused by landslides and provide real-time alerts to local authorities.

## Installation

To run the project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for running code interactively)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, etc.
